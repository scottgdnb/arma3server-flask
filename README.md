# arma3server-flask
## Browser front-end / app to control a Linux Arma3Server / SteamCMD server.

I chucked this together to control an ARMA 3 server I had running on an old PC locally a while ago. 

It's not very optimised or secure (runs stuff in sudo) but it didn't need to be for my purposes at the time. If you use it *BE AWARE* if you are intending to have things open on the wider internet.
